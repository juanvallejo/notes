**AMD and Intel: A Statistical Analysis of Processor Performance and Benchmarking**

Computers are an integral piece of the puzzle that is modern life; they are utilized in both professional life and for leisure, they inhabit every room in a modern household, and one can even carry computers with more power than could have been dreamed of. 

Inside any of these devices you will find the Central Processing Unit, or CPU, this is the brain of the computer, an overused analogy, but it is overused for a reason. It the part of the computer where most of the actual computing, or thinking to continue the brain metaphor, occurs; nothing happens on a computer without at least running through the CPU. As the most critical portion of what is arguably the most important device one uses on a daily basis, no small amount of attention is dedicated to deciding which brand of processor is most desirable inside a consumer’s computer. 
Today the market for CPU’s has been largely been controlled by two rival companies, Advanced Micro Devices, better known by the abbreviation AMD, and Intel, both of which began business in manufacturing and developing CPU’s shortly after their invention in the 1960’s. If there is a debate surrounding processor performance in either desktop or notebook computers, comparing and contrasting the two companies is inevitable, and when attempting to deduce which company produces the highest performing processor from a statistical standpoint, a commonly used tool is benchmarking. Benchmarking refers to a number of different metrics which are used to compare the performance of CPU’s in a numerical fashion, and there exist numerous different techniques of benchmarking to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of any given processor. 

Some of the most common criterion for analyzing processor performance are the speed at which the processor operates at, or clock rate, and the number of CPU’s, alternately named cores, that are a part of a processor, and can be physical or virtual. Also an important part of the discussion of differing processors is whether benchmarks themselves are a legitimate way to criticize the power of a processor.
