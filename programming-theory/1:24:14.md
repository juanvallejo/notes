**ALGOL 58**

- Types (more than just float)
- Names of any length for `vars` (Fortran I had 6 max)
- Arrays with
	- subscripts in `[ ]`
	- any boundaries
- Parameters passing by mode (in & out)
- Assignment operator was `:=` (from `=>` to `=:`)
- `if`
	- had an `else-if` clause
	- could be nested (Fortran I couldn't)
	
**ALGOL 60**

- Meeting in Paris (1960)
- Sucesses
	- Standard to publish algorithms for 20+ years
	- First language to be designed by committee
	- first machine-independent language
	- First language with formally defined syntax
- Failures
	- Not widely adopted (especially US)

**CoBOL**

- Common Business Oriented Language
- Fragmented market
	- UNIVAC (Flow-matic), USAF, UBM
	- First language required by DoD (1959)
- Design goals
	- Must look like simple English
	- Must be easy to use, even if less powerful
- Contributions
	- Hierarchical data structures (records)
	- Long names with hyohens
	Separate data & procedure division

**NPL**

- Conflicting environments began to cross
	- Scientific computing (FORTRAN)
	- Business computing (COBOL)
- An extension of Fortran IV
	- Called NPL (changed to PL/1 in 1965)
- Contributions
	- First sub-program concurrency and exception handling
		- Used for MULTICS an early multi-tasking OS

**SIMULA 67**
 
- Designed in Norway for system simulations
- Based on SIMULA I and ALGOL 60
- Contributions
	- First Object-Oriented language
	- Implemented in a structure called a class
		- structure that has local data and functionality
	- Co-routines - subprograms that remember their last point of execution

**Prolog**

- Programming Logic
- Developed in 1972

**Pascal**

- Designed by Niklaus Wirth in 1971
	- member of the ALGOL committee
- Most impact: teaching programming
	- based mostly on ALGOL 60
	- Small & simple (but limited)
	
**Java**

- Designed by James Gosling
	- Originally called Oak
	- Intended fro electronic devices
- Simplification of C++
	- No unions or pointers (dangerous)
	- OOP but not a pure OO language
	- applets for dynamic content
	- rich & accessible library

**C#**

- Created by Anders Hejlsberg
- Based on C++, Java & Delphi (Turbo Pascal)
- Part of Microsoft's .NET platform
	- All .NET languages

**JavaScript**

- Created by Brendan Eich @ Netscape
- Initially called LiveScript
- Web programming (client side)
- Related to java only through similar syntax
- object-based: no inheritance, no polymorphism

**PHP**

- Created by Rasmus Lerdorf
- Initially called Personal Home Page
- Latern renamed PHP: Hypertext Prepocessor
- Web programming (server side)
- outputs HTML
