- **Arithmetic expressions**
	- They consist of
		- operators
		- Operands
		- parenthesis
		- function calls
	- **Operators**
		- **Types**
			- *Unary* operator has one operand
				- `i++`
			- *Binary* operator has two operands
				- `a + b`
			- *Ternary* operator has three operands
		- **Precedence rules**
			- Define the evaluation order of adjacent operators
			- Typical precedence levels
		- **Order of Operand Evaluation**
			- Functional side effects
				 - A variable in an epxression is modified within a function that is also in the expression, and where
				 	- the variable is passed as a reference, or
				 	- the variable is global
		- **Operator overloading**
			- Operators used for more than one purpose
			- commonly found in languages
				- `+ * / for int & float`
				- some are a potential source of bugs
		- **Type conversions**
			- Mixed-mode expressions
				- Expressions with operands of different types
					- Coercion
						- an implicit type conversions
- **Relational & Boolean expressions**
	- C
		- No Boolean type
		- uses integers where `0 is afalse and non-zero is true`
		- Odity
			- `a < b < c`
			- is legal (it does compile & run)
				- `a < b` is evaluated, producing `0` or `1`
				- this result is compared with `< c`
