**Associative Arrays**

They are

- *unordered* collection of *(key, value)* pair elements
- indexed by *keys*

In Perl

- Variable names begin with %
	- `%temps = ("Mon" => 77, "Tue" => 79, "Wed" => 65, ...);`
- Susbcripting is done using braces and keys
	- `$temps{"Wed"} = 83;`
- Elements can be removed with `delete`
  
&nbsp;  
**Records** are classes with no methods. It is a likely heterogeneous aggregate of data type elements. Elements are identified by name.

- **Heterogeneous** data values
- field names are *fixed*

**Arrays**

- **homogeneous** data values
- element locations are calculated

*Records* have faster access to their fields than arrays have to its elements.

**Unions**

- Records whose fields can alternate storing values of different types at different times during execution. They are used to overlap types in memory.

**Pointers**

- used for dynamic storage management
- In C / C++
    - Extremely flexible
    - can point at any variable at any location
        - heap & stack
- **Problems**
	- Dangling pointers
		- When a pointer points to a heap-dynamic space that has been de-callocated
	- Lost heap-dynamic variables
		- When a heap dynamic value is no longer accessible (becomes "garbage")
		
- **Solutions**
	- Tombstones solve dangling pointers
		- Pointers point to tombstones
		- Tombstones point to heap spaces
		- When a heap scape is de-callocated, its tombstone is set to `NULL`
- **Garbage collection**
	- Lazy approach
		- reclaiming garbage when memory is low
	- Memory allocated as requested
	- Pointers reference memory as needed
	- When memory is running low
		- all memory spaces set to garbage
		- all pointers traced into heap
		- any unreachable cells are garbage
	- Disadvantagaes
		- Program stops until process ends
