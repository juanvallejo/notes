**Pigeonhole Principle**

- **Definition**
	- If `k` is a positive integer and `k+1` objects are placed into k boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects. It is about mapping `k+1` `x's` to `k` `y's`
- **Generalized Pigeonhole principle**
	- If `N` objects are placed into `k` boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least `N/k` objects
- **Solving for N**
	- `[N] / 4 = 3`
		- `N = (ans - 1) * (denominator) + 1`
