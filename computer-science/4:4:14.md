**Binary Trees**

- Two-Three Trees
	- each internal node has 2 or 3 kids
	- all leaves at same level
	- If you have a binary tree, you have a `two-three tree`
	- always balanced
	- has at least as many nodes as a full binary tree `(2^h -1)`
	- so height is at most `log(n+1)`
	- worst case for access is `log(n)`
	- empty or
	- TL, r, TR, or
	- TL, r1, TM, r2, TR
	- where TL, TM, TR are two-three trees and
	- height of the tree is exactly one more than each of its subtrees
	- `v(TL) < r1 < v(TM) < r2 < v(TR)`
- Inorder Traversal

	```
		public void inorder(TTTnode n) {
			if(n == null)
				return;
			if(isLeaf(n))
				print(n.r1, n.r2);
			else if(twoNode(n)) {
				inorder(n.left);
				print(n.r1);
				inorder(n.right);
			} else if(threeNode) ...
		}
	```
- Insert
	- inserting a node in a BST starts at root and can follow several paths, leading to possible imbalance
	- inserting in 2-3 tree always starts at a leaf, with nodes propagating upwards
	- if empty, create new node
	- 1 element node: add item to node,
- Leaf that is a three node
	- pretende you insert into leaf (insert 8)
	- split the leaf in three, TL, rot, TR, by promoting the iddle element to the root
	- tree grows upwards, maintains all leaves at same level
- non-full parent
	- inset into full leaf with a non-full parent
	- starts with full leaf case, middle promoted to parent
	- parent not full, so same as case of non full leaf
