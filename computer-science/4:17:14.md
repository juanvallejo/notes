**Tables**

- search key per record
- simplest strategy: sequential file of records sorted by search key
- traverse file - sequential access
- retrieve record - binary search

**Indexed advantages**

- index is very small, often loadable inram
- data file records have no need to be sorted or even sequential
- multiple indexes possible, adds power to searching

**How Many recrods**

- if node has m kids, it has `m-1` keys
- each node then stores m pointers, m-1 index records
- calculate m based upon size of block
- let pointer be 1 byte, index record 3 bytes

**B-Tree**

- In order to make balancing less complex, require each node to have at most m and at least `m / 2` (round down) + 1 kids
- All leaves at same level
- this is a B-tree of degree m
