Descartes's second argument: nonexistence is an imperfection, therefore, proving God exists.  
Physical objects exist, as it is believed God has put in the mind the strong inclination to believe in such objects and their existence, therefore, ruling the theory that states material objects only reside in the mind, false.

**Descartes 6th Meditation**
