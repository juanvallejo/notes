**Patanjali** (Yoga sutra)

We resumed class by talking about `Patanjali yoga sutra`, the yoga of discipline of the mind. When a sincere seeker approaches an elightened teacher, with an attitude of `discipleship` and with the right spirit of enquiry, at the rigtht time and the right place, `explanation of yoga` takes place.

`Yoga` happens when there is stilling of the movement of thought; `without effortless suppression` in the indivisible intelligence in which there is no movement.

In light of non-volitional, non-moving and therefore spontaneous and choiceless awareness, the undivided intelligence (consciousness, sentience) with its apparent and passing modifications od movememnts of thought within itself is not confused with nor confied to any of these. Then the `seer` is not split up into one or the other of the states or modifications of the mind, and `exists by itself and as itself`.

At other times, when yoga does not happen and when the mind is busily occupied with the movement, there is a cloud of confusion in the undivided, homogeneuous intelligence. In the shadow of that cloud, there arises false identification or cognition of the movement of the `mind-fragment` and hence distorted understanding.

*In Backta yoga you suppress your own ego*.

- `Seer` is a homogeneuous intelligence which is ignorantly regarded as the separate experiencer of sensations and emotions, and the separate performer of actions.
- `Moksha` is freedom from bondage, joys, and sorrows of your psychophysical being. The experiencing of yourself as the witness, rather than the participant.
- `Aphroism` is a very concise statement.
