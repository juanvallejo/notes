__Kepler__

- careful measurements of the distance between stars
- speed and movements among them
- based upon measurements by Blehr
- Copernicus argued planets moved in circles around the sun
- Kepler argued planets moved in an elliptical shape around the sun

__Galileo__

- used mathematics to explain observations
- observations to support terrestial motion and copernican theories
- thought of the celestial as being no different in composition from the terrestrial
- Believed in primary properties (secondary properties are not real)


__Descartes__

- Dualist as he separated everything into mind and matter

<br />

```
Modernity is a term to refer to the perdiod from the 16th century to the present.

__Mathematical Universe__: In a natural standpoint, things look the same when we look at them as when we don't look at them. Galileo challenges this viewpoint by saying these secondary qualities do not exist.

__Mechaincal Universe__:
Universe is described as a mechanical universe. If something moves, something moves it. Nothing is animate. Everything is governed by cause and effect.
<br />

This threatens God and religious beliefs, as the `mechanical universe` theory explains that all motion is moved motion... There is no self-moved motion, perpetually occurring throughout time which leads to the concept of **infinity**.
