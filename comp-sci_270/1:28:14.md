Data type: `int` `double`  
Data structure: `Array`

**Abstract data types** are collections of data and valid operations on that data.  

- Encapsulates data and operations
- hides data and operations that are not needed by clients

*Encapsulation* combines data and operations  

*Info hiding* is the ability to make attributes / operations inaccessible to clients.

```
public class Rational {
	//attributes
	private int num, den;
	
	//methods
	public Rational mult(Rational rat) {
		Rational prod = new Rational();
		prod.num = this.num * rat.num;
		prod.den = this.den * rat.den;
		
		return prod;
	}
}
```

**Typical operations**

- create a `new` instance of the ADT
- add to the data collection of the instance
- remove from the data collection
- inquire about the data collection

**Example list**

- List is a sequence of elements

<br />

**Unified Modeling Language**

**Axioms**

- accepted basic property of a system
- invariant for ADT operations
- Example: multiplication
	- associative: `a * (b * c) + d`
