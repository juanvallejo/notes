***Probability and algorithms***

The `order` of a polynomial is the highest power

Big O if it is less than or equal to the given function

**Equiprobable distribution**  
Probability that item looked for is anywhere on the list.  
Interpreted as `1/n`  
Probability item is at `i`th location.

`p(n) == p(i) -> probability of 1/n`

`probability x cost == p(i) x i (i is the cost == average number of searches`

`1/n sum[i=1..n] i == 1/n(n(n+1)/2) == (n+1) / 2`

If you are sure of having low values of `n`, keep it simple (algorithmically)

Be aware of space-time tradeoffs

**Sorting**  
*A sequence `S` is sorted if given any two elements `S[i]` and `S[i+1]`, `S[i] < S[i+1]`*

```
int[] arrayOfInts = {0,1,2,3,4};

boolean isSorted(int[] array) {
	boolean response = true;

	for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++) {
		if(!(array[i+1] && array[i] < array[i+1])) response = false;
		else if(i == array.length-1 && !array[i] > array[i-1]) response = false;
	}
	
	return response;
}

```

**Bubble sort**  
Given a sequence `S` of `n` items, compare two asjacent items at a time and swap them if they are "out of order"

After one such pass, the largest item is at the end of the sequence.

Repeat with the rest of the items.

**Analysis**

Nested loops  
outer loop occurs n times  
inner loop occurs k times  
how many comps? moves?  
this is sum `[i=1..n]i` which is `O(n^2)`

Performance if the array is already sorted in ascending order  
`O(n)`
