Induction proofs work by showing that a base case is **true**.

If you can show that the claim is true for `n = k + 1` by assuming it's true for `n = k`, then the claim must be true for all values of n since `k` could be any number.

**Factorial**

```
Prove: n! = fact(n)		n > 0	

Base: fact(1) = 1

Assume: fact(k) = k!
		fact(k + 1) = (k + 1)!

Claim: fact(n) = n!
