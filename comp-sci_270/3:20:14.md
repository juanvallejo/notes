**Binary Trees**

*A `null` tree is a valid, complete tree*

- *leaf*: Node with no children
- *descendant*: a node down to which there is a path from this node
- *level of a node*: 1 if a node is root, else level of `parent + 1`
- *height* is the number of nodes on longest path from root to a leaf

- **Full binary tree**
    - all nodes not at last level have both left and right kids
    - has all possible leaves
    - adding a node forces a new level
- **Recursive definition**
        - if T is empty, it is a full binary tree
        - else it has two subtrees which are full binary trees of height one less than T
- **Complete Binary Tree**
    - *only trees that have `2^n - 1` nodes can be full*
    - let `h` be the height of a complete binary tree
    - the tree of height h-1 is full
    - if a node at level `h-1` has a child, all nodes to its left have both kids
    - if a node at level `h-1` has one kid, it's the left kid

*Think of it as filling in a tree from top to bottom, left to right*

*All full trees are complete trees, but not all complete trees are full trees*

- a binary tree is balanced if for any node, the height of its left subtree and right subtree differ by no more than 1
- for any node n, `|h(left(n)) - h(right(n))| < 2`
- A binary tree T is balanced if it's empty

- **Traversal**
- visit all the nodes in a tree recursively
- doing something to the root before any of the subtrees is a *pre-order traversal*
- doing something to the root in-between visiting the kids is an *in-order traversal*
- doing something to the root after visiting the kids is a *post-order traversal*
