###Analysis Phase

Functional specification

- Completely defines tasks to be solved
- Free from internal specification

###Design Phase

Goals

- Identify classes
- Identify behavior of classes
- Identify relationships among classes

Artifacts

- Textual description of classes and key methods
- Diagrams of class relationships
- Diagrams of important usage scenarios
- State diagrams for objects with rich state

###Implementation Phase

- Implement and test classes
- Combine classes into program
- Avoid "big bang" integration
- Prototypes can be very useful

An object is anything that has `state` `behavior` and `identity`
