##Double-DES?

- Could use 2 DES encryptions on each block
	- C = E_k2( E_ki ( P ) )
- but have "meet-in-the-middle" attack
	- works ehenever use a cipher twice
	- since X = E_ki (P) = D_k2 ( C )

Could still be broken

##Triple-DES with Two-Keys

- must use three encyptions
	- would seem to need three distinct keys
- but can also use 2 keys with E-D-E sequence
	- C = E_ki ( D_k2 ( E_ki ( P ) ) )
	-  if k_1 == k_2 then can work with single DES
- Several proposed impractical attacks might become basis of future attacks

##Modes of Operation

- block ciphers encrypt fixed sized blocks
	- e.g. DES encrypts 64bit blocks with 56-bit key
- need some way to en/decrypt arbitraty amounts of data in practice
- have block and stream modes

##Electronic Codebook Book (ECB)

- Message is broken into independent blocks which are encrypted
- each block is a value which is substituted, like a codebook
- eacj block is encoded independently of the other blocks

##Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)

- message is broken into blocks
- linked together in encryption operation
- each previous cipher block is chained with current plaintext blocks
- Each ciphertext block depends on all previous plaintext blocks

##Message Padding

- at end of message must handle a possible last short block
	- which is not as large as block size of cipher
	- pad either with nulls
	- or pad last block along with count of pad size
		- e.g. [ b1 b2 b3 0 0 0 0 5 ]
		- means have three data bytes, then 5 bytes pad + count
	- this may require an extra entire block over those in message
- There are other, more esoteric modes, which avoid the need for an extra block

##Advantages and Limitations of CBC

- a ciphertext block depends on all blocks before it
- any change to a block affects all following ciphertext blocks
- need Initialization Vector (IV)
	- which must be known to sender & receiver
	- if sent in clear, attacker can change bits of first block, and change IV to compensate
	- hence IV must be either a fixed value
	- or must be sent encrypted in ECB mode before rest of message
