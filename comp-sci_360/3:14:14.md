###Primitive Data Types###

**Unicode**

- 16 bits
- first 127 characters are ASCII
- supports multiple languages

**Length Types**

- Static
	- fixed capacity & length (immutable)
	- Java's `String` class
- Limited Dynamic
	- fixed capacity, flexible length
	- C & C++: `\0` as delimiter
	- Pascal: each string's length is stored in an initial byte
- Dynamic
	- Flexible capacity & length
		- Java's StringBuilder & StringBuffer class

**Stack Index Binding**

*Fixed stack-dynamic*

- Storage allocation @ compile time
- subscript ranges @ compile time
	- e.g. `static int array[9]`
- Advantage
	- efficiency (no dynamic allocation)
	
*Stack-dynamic Index Binding*

- Storage allocation @ runtime, stack-based
- subscript ranges @ runtime
	- e.g., `int array[i]`
- Advantage:
	- flexibility (array size can change at runtime as needed)
