**Modulatiry**

- C
	- Modularity construct: `Struct`
		- instances
			- each has its own data members
			- do not contain operations
			- can be static, stack-dynamic or hea-dynamic
	- Data hiding
		- interface is placed in a "header" file, with declarations of the implementation file
- C++
	- Constructors
		- Same name as class
		- initializes all data members
	-Destructors
		- Same name as class, but preceded by a tilde `~`
- Java
	- Similar to C++, except that
		- All user defined types are classes (not structs)
		- Objects are heap dynamic, held with references
		- No (explicit) destructors
		- No individual entities have access control modifiers, rather than clauses
		- Clauses are grouped in packages
